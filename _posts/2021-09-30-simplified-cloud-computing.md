# What is Cloud Computing ? 

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service rather than a product. This typically involves using Internet technologies to provide convenient, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

- Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the Internet, rather than from a local server or your own PC. It’s popular because it can be cheaper and more convenient than traditional methods. For example, you might use Google Docs to create and edit documents online instead of using Microsoft Word on your laptop. You can also 'talk' to friends via Skype instead of calling them on the phone.

- Cloud computing is a term used to describe a type of Internet-based computing where resources are provided as a service over the Internet. This means that the user only needs to pay for resources as they use them, instead of paying upfront for all resources.

- Cloud computing is a term that refers to using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data. Cloud computing services are usually provided via the internet.

# Advantages 


Cloud computing is a new technology that will change the way we live and work. Cloud computing is the use of a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than using local servers or personal computers.

When we say Cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service rather than a product. 
It means that your business can pay for only what it needs, when it needs it, and how much it needs. You can scale up or down instantly with no upfront investment.

In the past, IT was a capital expense that you had to pay for up front. This meant that many companies did not have the funds to upgrade their systems.

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of hosted services over the Internet. Cloud-based services are usually accessed via a web browser, but can also be accessed using specialized software.

It offers many pricing ways to become suitable for your bussiness needs , we'll talk about the pricing

Every New Technology doesn't come only with advantage let's talk bit about the tradeoffs that may not suitable for you


# Disadvantage 


- 
Cloud computing is an important technology, but there are some disadvantages. For example, it's difficult to control the security of data stored in the cloud. It's also hard to integrate applications that run on different cloud platforms.


- 
The cloud is great for storing and accessing your data, but there are some disadvantages. For example, you need to access the internet and the cloud service provider's servers in order to use it. If you can't access the internet or if your service provider's servers go down, then you can't use the cloud.


- 
Some people may think that cloud computing is the same as using the internet. However, cloud computing is different in many ways. For example, it can be used to share information between two or more computers that are not located in the same place.

**Pricing !!**



> 
Cloud Computing Service Providers like AWS ( Amazon Web Services ), GCP (Google Cloud Platform) and Microsoft Azure are investing alot of money on researches and build high quality infrastructure hardware they offer alot of payment methods that will offer many suitable ways to expand your business 

### Let's Explore the Top 3 Pricing Types from the Cloud Service Provider (AWS) Which have the most shares in the market 


- 
**Pay-as-you-go
**
Pay-as-you-go allows you to easily adapt to changing business needs without overcommitting budgets and improving your responsiveness to changes. With a pay-as-you-go model, you can adapt your business depending on need and not on forecasts, reducing the risk of overprovisioning or missing capacity.

- 
**Pay less by using more
**
With AWS, you can get volume based discounts and realize important savings as your usage increases. For services such as S3, pricing is tiered, meaning the more you use, the less you pay per GB. AWS also gives you options to acquire services that help you address your business needs.


- 
**Save when you commit
**
For AWS Compute and AWS Machine Learning, Savings Plans offer savings over On-Demand in exchange for a commitment to use a specific amount (measured in $/hour) of an AWS service or a category of services, for a one- or three-year period.
